	<h1>The Basics to Flipping NFTs in the Bear Market</h1>
	<p>Brought to you by Banana Phone Alpha with @MadbananasUnion and @Kyottte.</p>
	<p>Flipping NFTs can be a lucrative way to invest in the crypto market, but it's important to do your research and be aware of potential risks.</p>
	<h2>Understanding Blockchain Technology and NFTs</h2>
	<p>Before diving into flipping NFTs, it's important to understand the basics of blockchain technology and how it applies to NFTs. NFTs are unique digital assets that are verified on a blockchain, making them one-of-a-kind and valuable.</p>
	<h2>The "Buy 3" Strategy</h2>
	<p>One common tactic in flipping NFTs is the "buy 3" strategy. Buy 3 NFTs, sell 2 when you hit your target price, and hold 1 for the moon. This helps reduce risk and increase potential profits.</p>
	<h2>Setting a Stop Loss</h2>
	<p>It's also important to have a stop loss in place to manage risk. Setting a stop loss at around 10-20% is a good rule of thumb to prevent significant losses.</p>
	<h2>Red Flags for Scam NFT Projects</h2>
	<p>Be aware of red flags for scam NFT projects, such as wash trading or newly-formed social media accounts with a high follower count and little engagement.</p>
	<p>In particular, be cautious of unverified links in Discord channels or direct messages. One good practice is to manually type in the link after verifying it with a trusted member of the community.</p>
	<h2>Timing is Key</h2>
	<p>When flipping derivative mints, consider buying at the lowest possible entry point, taking into account transaction fees and GWEI prices. Derivative mints often peak around 0.02 ETH and then retrace, so timing is key.</p>
	<h2>Do Your Own Research</h2>
	<p>As with any investment, it's important to do your own research and not rely solely on the advice of others. Keep up-to-date with the latest trends and news in the NFT market to make informed decisions.</p>
	<h2>Conclusion</h2>
	<p>In conclusion, flipping NFTs can be a profitable investment strategy, but it requires caution and research. Use strategies like the "buy 3" tactic and stop losses to manage risk, and be wary of red flags for scam projects. Remember to always be cautious and take the time to do your own research before investing in any NFT project. Happy flipping!</p>
